# Dimensionality Reduction in Binary Text Classification Using Regularized Logistic Regression

One of the biggest problems taxing modern data analysis and modeling is that of compu- tational cost and efficiency. This is especially true when working with sufficiently large, high-dimensional data matrices, a ubiquitous occurrence in the areas of text analysis and natural language processing. We investigate the practical benefits that are gained from considering dimensionality reduction techniques in the context of a binary text classification problem. To assess the impacts such a matrix approximation may have, we look at using reg- ularized logistic regression to serve as our model so that we may compare predictive accuracy across models using full, high-dimensional data versus those using the reduced data.
